# Papers

As time permits, I will actively organize, summarize, review and reflect each paper that I find interesting, etc

## Overview 

- [clustering](clustering): Things generally related to Unsupervised Learning, (KNN, KMeans, EM, ...)
- [deeplearning](deeplearning): All Neural Networks -- will be more specific in the future
- [gpu](gpu): All GPU Programming related
- [reinforcement](reinforcement): Things generally related to Reinforcement Learning
- [search](search): All things "search" related (Path-finding, Tree-Spanning, Adversarial, ...)
- [misc](misc): None of the above or not yet decided
- [notes](notes): Random notes during review, presentations, or not yet decided

## Thoughts and Reflection

...

## TODOs:

- Split Deep Learning section into types of NNs
- Have Notes be per-directory, per-paper
