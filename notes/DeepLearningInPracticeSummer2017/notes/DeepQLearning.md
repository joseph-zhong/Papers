# DQN: Deep Q Learning 

- 3 Aug. 2017
- UWCSE Deep Learning in Practice, Summer
- Presented by Aaron Walsman


## Problems with applying Deep Learning with Q Learning

- Deep Learning requires non-correlated training samples 
- However environments occuring in sequence have significant correlation

## Memory Replay

- Introduced by DQN Paper

### Torch

- Torch is easy, except...
- CartPole Tutorial took about a day
  - Generalization was difficult: harder environments don't generalize by method
  - Hyperparameters are unclear on how to modify
