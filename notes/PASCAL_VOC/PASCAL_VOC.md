- Paper: The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge

## Overview

- Benchmark in Visual Object Category recognition and detection
- 2005-2012: Accepted as the standard benchmark in object detection

## Tasks and Datasets

### Classification
For 20 object classes, predict presence/absence of objects in test images

### Detection
For each of the 20 object classes, predict bounding boxes for each object in test images (if any)

### Segmentation
Predict the object class of each pixel in test images, or "background" if the pixel doesn't correspond to any of the 20 object classes

### Person Layout 
Detect people, and provide bounding boxes, and the presence/absence of head/hands/feet and the bounding boxes of those parts in test images
