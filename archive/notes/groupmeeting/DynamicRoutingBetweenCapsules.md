# Dynamic Routing Between Capsules

- UWCSE Research Recognition Autumn 2017
- Presented by Minjoon Seo
- Notes by Joseph Zhong

## CapsNet

- 1 Layer Convolution

- Multiple Pimary Capsules

  - Each capsule outputs a vector $v_j$ 
  - The vectors can interpreted as a probability distribution over classes
  - However the vectors can be used to reconstruct the input
